* Hubot plan

** Front End
   This will be for configuring some of the features, getting stats, etc.
   so buttons and control panel design will be defined by much of the back end.
** Back End
   This will be mostly hubot code written by others, 
    although I might need to write custom code to hook onto the front end stuff.
** Persistence
   The database layer is the "optional" layer.
